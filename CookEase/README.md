#40005 Advanced iOS development - Assignment 2
## Student: Yudong Lu
## Github URL: https://github.com/Daniel01010100/CookEase.git

## Github Branch
### Beta - Actively developed version, may contains bugs
### Main - Stable version. (Used for assignment submission)

## Manual
###  SignUp (Please use a valid email, such as YDL@gmail.com) 
###  -> SignIn -> Home (Default, not implemented)
###  -> Setting (Please set your diet, equipment you have, and your intolerance)
###  -> Cook (Please input a query, choose the amount, and tap on "Get instruction")) -> CookingInstruction
###         CheckList is also not implemented.
### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------             
### Please be careful, the Spoonacular API only provide 50 times requests per day, and the amount of request is equal to 1(search recipes based on query) + n (the amount of returned recipes) + 1 (fetch cooking instruction for recipe).

## Explaination (Please read the explaination in its entirely)
###     This is a software called CookEase based on the idea of Assignment 1, which includes personal preference, recipe search, and cooking method introduction. This app leverage an API called Spoonacular, which is a quite comprehensive cooking data provider. 
###     However, I found that the data it provided often contained empty data, was nested, and had the same JSON keys but completely inconsistent values ​​across different endpoints. Furthermore, searching for recipes required multiple simultaneous API calls to retrieve both dish search results and related information. These omissions and errors significantly increased my testing workload.
###     Additionally, I have tried to integrate the kSecClass with the CookEase app to store user's password. However, due to its high difficulty and my limited ability, the code of kSecClass is basically generated by ChatGPT, not written by me. Therefore, in order to ensure that this assignment is completely written by me, I deleted the related codes.

###     Unfortunately, I had an acute eye infection a week before the assignment was due, which left me completely unable to write any code for a week. This meant that even though I had applied for an extension request, I still didn't have enough time, so some features were not implemented (such as password reset, recipe recommendations based on the ingredients the user already had, and getting nutritional information for dishes).

## Reflection
###     During the development process, I encountered critical issues regarding planning and backend integration. Firstly, I realised the importance of thoroughly evaluating third-party APIs before implementation. It's fatal to select an incomplete or unreliable API, which can lead to significant delays and rework. Secondly, I learned that model design should strictly follow the API’s JSON structure. Creating models based on assumptions will led to incompatibilities and wasted effort. These insights will improve my efficiency when working with external data sources in the future.
